abstract = {Implementing solutions for optimisation problems with general-purpose programming languages is a time consuming task that can only be carried out by professional software developers who typically are not domain experts. We address this problem by developing the domain-specific language Athos that allows to declaratively specify models of problems such as the vehicle routing problem with time windows. These models serve as input to a generator that creates programs to solve the modelled problem in a multi-agent environment (NetLogo) which is further extended with a genetic algorithm optimiser.We discuss the overall Athos architecture and compare the source models with the generated code to demonstrate the benefit for developers. Furthermore, we present a qualitative assessment of the language by applying selected aspects of the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework.Beyond the quality criteria discussed in this paper future work will include extensive field experiments in which domain experts will apply Athos to their practical problems. A formal evaluation process will help to improve the usability and applicability of the language.},

abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},
